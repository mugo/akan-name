## Versioning
Akan name generator 1.0

## Description
Akan names are rooted in Ghanaian culture, where it's customary for children to receive a 'day name' corresponding to the day of the week they were born. This application allows users to input their birthdate through the provided form. By utilizing a formula assigned to a variable in the "akan.js" file (dayOfWeekNumber), the application calculates the specific day of the week of the user's birth. Subsequently, based on the user's gender selection, the app generates their Akan Name.

To achieve this, the app will gather the user's birth year, birth month, birth day, and chosen gender. The dayOfWeekNumber formula will facilitate the determination of the precise day of the week of the user's birth. Depending on the gender specified, the app will provide the user with their corresponding Akan name.
